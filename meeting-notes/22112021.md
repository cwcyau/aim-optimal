# Overview

Dominic and Steven went through exploration of an initial (positive control) CPRD extract (T2D - cardiac events).

We discussed methodological issues around missingness as well as bias and confounding.

Discussed real-world mechanisms underlying these observations.

Discussed the computing infrastructure to support the project (local cluster + Baskerville application).

# Actions

Marco/Peter to get access to data to conduct initial independent exploration and options for dimensionality reduction.

Request further exemplar data extracts that allow us to explore the multimorbidity aspect of the problem - link to clinical questions.

Dominic examining bespoke observation models for this type of real-world data.
