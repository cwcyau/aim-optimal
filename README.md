# AIM OPTIMAL

This is a repository for *Work Package 1: Cluster sequences and response to therapies in cMM* of NIHR-funded AIM OPTIMAL project led by University of Birmingham.

## Objectives

**RQ1:** What are the trajectories of diseases within clusters, including sub-clinical and advanced phenotypes of the disease, measured as a continuum using biomarkers and physiological measurements of disease severity? (**Objective 1**)

**RQ2:** Does choice of prescribed medications reduce or increase risk of development of a subsequent disease or complication of an existing disease? (**Objective 2**)

**RQ3:** Can we develop risk prediction algorithms to allow us to identify: 1) the likely next disease; and 2) the best treatment option where there are multiple choices (e.g. best second line treatment, in diabetes or disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug in rheumatoid arthritis)? (**Objective 3**)

**RQ4:** Do acute clinical expressions (hyperglycaemia, delirium, TIA) and clinical data (increased granularity â€“ features derived from images, electrophysiological findings, laboratory measurements) during hospital admissions and outpatient visits improve the predictive algorithms for future disease accumulation and therapeutic choice? (**Objective 4**)
